Database Module Documentation
=============================

[sMDT](sMDT.md).db is an important module to this library, and serves as the main interface for interaction with the persistent database.

The db module is the home of two classes, db and db_manager. An environment with this database consists of one computer/thread that manages the database, and the same computer or any number of additional computers that us the db class to read from the database and interact with the database manager to be able to write.

Without the db_manager running consistently, the database will not be regularly updated and will not work. However, it is extremely important that there is only ever one database manager running at a time. Talk to Paul (or his successor) before touching these classes. In the main directory, DatabaseManager.py is the lab's application that uses the db_manager class.

Currently, the data is actually stored a shelve database in a file all computers see as local (through dropbox, presumably). Each db class can access the database to read, but only the db_manager class is ever allowed to write to the database. WRITING TO THE DATABASE IS NEVER YOUR CODE'S RESPONSIBILITY. Use the db class. 


db class
--------

Member Function | Parameters | Return Value | Description
---|---|---|---
Constructor | mode : string, path : string | None | Constructs the database object. If a path is provided, it will be used as the path for the shelved database. The default database location is a file named `database.s`, one folder up from the directory containing db.py.
add_tube(tube) | tube : Tube() | None | Adds the provided tube object to the database. If the tube object is not in the database, it is added. If a tube with a matching ID is already in the database, the tubes are *added together.* The data that the tubes have is merely added together, a tube with 3 tension record plus a tube with 1 tension and a swage record equals a tube with 4 tension records and 1 swage record. --**WARNING**-- do not load a tube from the database, add your data to it, and add that tube back. This will cause it's initial data to be duplicated, since it's being added and it's already there. Instead, make a new tube and set the ID and the data before adding it to the database. Additionally, this data will not be written to the database and be readable by get_tube() until the database manager updates. This should be handled externally in real programs, but for test cases you will need to do it yourself. 
get_tube(id) | id : string | Tube() | Returns the tube with the corresponding id. If no such tube exists, it will raise a KeyError. May wait on a locked database, but delays should be uncommon and short
size() | None | int | Returns the size of the database, how many tubes total there are. May wait on a locked database like get_tube()

db_manager class
----------------

Member Function | Parameters | Return Value | Description
---|---|---|---
Constructor | mode : string, path : string, archive : bool, testing : bool| None | Constructs the database manager object. If a path is provided, it will be used as the path for the shelved database. The default database location is a file named `database.s`, one folder up from the directory containing db.py. archive and testing both default to false. If testing is true, then the station pickler needed to interfact with the legacy stations is not ran. For cases where you're only using the db class to add tubes to the database, which is common in testing. If testing is false, the tests will take drastically longer to run. If testing is false, the archive parameter is passed directly to the station_pickler class. If it's true, the pickler deletes the files it reads and moves them to an archive directory to prevent duplicate data when update is ran repeatedly. See the [legacy](legacy.md) module for full documentation. 
update(logging) | logging : bool | None | Updates the database by collecting new tubes marked for adding by the db class (or the station_pickler legacy class) and adding them to the database. The db and pickler classes mark tubes for adding by pickling them into a file that ends in '.tube' and putting them in the directory sMDT/new_data. Locks the database during the write operation. Deletes the pickle files after it's done with them. If testing was false, this operation runs the station_pickler to build the .tube files before this function reads them in. If logging is true (by default), then the program will output many lines that correspond to what it's doing via print(). 
wipe(confirm) | confirm : string | None | Wipes the database by deleting all the data. **EXTREME CAUTION ADVISED** confirm must be exactly the string "confirm" for wipe to work. Raises RuntimeError if confirm argument is not properly supplied.
cleanup() | None | None | Cleans corrupted/duplicate picked tubes and lock files. This is specifically to cleanup how crashed applications can leave .lock and .tube files, but this can and will delete all valid locks and tubes too. Only call this if you know what you're doing. 

Usage
-----
Below is a simple example of using the db classes.
```python

from sMDT import tube, db                                     #import the relevant modules
from sMDT.data import tension
tubes = db.db()                                                #make the database object
dbman = db.db_manager(testing=True)                                        #make the db manager object. NOT NEEDED IF ON THE REAL LAB SYSTEM OR ANY OUTSIDE THE TEST ENVIRONMENT, WILL BE RAN BY THE DATABASE MANAGER PROGRAM
tube1 = mini_tube.Mini_tube()                                            #instantiate tubes
tube2 = mini_tube.Mini_tube()
tube1.m_tube_id = "MSU0000001"                                 #make them both have them same ID
tube2.m_tube_id = "MSU0000001"
tube1.tension.add_record(tension.TensionRecord(350))           #add two different tension records
tube2.tension.add_record(tension.TensionRecord(355))
tubes.add_tube(tube1)                                          #add the first tube
dbman.update()                                                 #update the database. NOT NEEDED ON REAL LAB SYSTEM
print(tubes.get_tube("MSU0000001").tension.get_record())       #print the tube's tension record, should be 350
tubes.add_tube(tube2)                                          #add the first tube
dbman.update()                                                 #update the database. NOT NEEDED ON REAL LAB SYSTEM
print(tubes.get_tube("MSU0000001").tension.get_record('last')) #print the tube's last tension record, should be 355 now
```

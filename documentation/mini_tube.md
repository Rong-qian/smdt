Mini_tube Module Documentation
=============================

[sMDT](sMDT.md).tube is the module that contains the Mini_tube class, which is inherit from the tube class.

This object only directly holds it's ID and the comments associated with it. It also holds several [Station](station.md) objects, one for each station the tube should go through. These station objects are tasked with storing the data associated with that station

Members
----------------

Member Variable | Type | Description
---|---|---
m_tube_id | string | represents the ID number/string of a tube. Use getters and setters rather than direct access.
m_comments | list[string] | a list of comments associated with the tube.  Use getters and setters rather than direct access.
swage | [SwageStation](swage.md) | Swage Station object
position | [PositionStation](position.md) | Position Station object
leak | [LeakStation](leak.md) | Leak Station object
tension | [TensionStation](tension.md) | Tension Station Object
darkcurrent | [DarkCurrentStation](darkcurrent.md) | Dark Current Station object
legacy_data | dict() | A generic dictionary for arbitrary data associated with legacy operations. Most likely empty. Only current key is "is_munich", a true or false value representing whether the munich type of endplug was used for this tube. 

Member Function | Parameters | Return Value | Description
---|---|---|---
Constructor | None | None | Constructs the tube object. Empty with no data or ID, must be set by user. 
new_comment(comment)| comment : string | None | Adds the new comment to the list of comments
get_comments() | None | list[string] | Returns the list of comments
get_ID(),set_ID(ID) | None, ID | string, None | Simple getter and setter for the tube's ID.
fail() | None | boolean | Returns true if the tube is a failure. A tube is considereed a failure if any of it's station's fail() functions return true. The stations fail functions just use the default mode. 
status() | None | [Status Enum](status.md) | Returns an Enum representing the status of a tube. A tube is either a Status.PASS, a Status.FAIL, or a Status.INCOMPLETE. status() will return Status.FAIL IF AND ONLY IF fail() returns True.  
\_\_str\_\_() | None | string | returns string representation of the tube.
\_\_add\_\_(tube) | tube : Tube | Tube | operator override for '+' operator. You shouldn't use this, it exists so tube + tube is meaninful when adding to the database. 


Usage
-----
Below is a simple example of using the tube class.
```python
from sMDT import mini_tube                                #import the tube module
from sMDT.data import tension                        #import the tension module
tube1 = mini_tube.Mini_tube()                                  #make a new tube object
tube1.m_id = "MSU000001"                             #set it's ID
tube1.tension.add_record(tension.TensionRecord(1.5)) #see the station and the tension module for explanation of this line
tube1.new_comment("This tube is an example")         #add a comment
